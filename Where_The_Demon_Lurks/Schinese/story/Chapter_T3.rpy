    old "Funny, the name of the collar Morris put on Toast is the Sun Wu Kong collar. I know this from the old T.V. shows I’ve seen on Earth, there is this monkey god that had to travel with a monk, they were going to the West! Oh, that’s why it’s called Journey to the West. In the show, the monkey god had a golden headband put on him, when the monk would read out a prayer the band would tighten around the monkey god, punishing him for his misbehaviours! Apparently the show is based on a real life myth! I hope it’s just that, a myth. I don’t want to meet no monkey god, who knows what trouble that can lead to. Even if there was one, I doubt it would have survived what Paw did to their kind. Oh! Idea, ask to borrow a similar collar for my Overlord cosplay at the shop’s Halloween party!"

I recall they would make souls live out their existence, melding their flesh with the very objects they coveted as mortals. Their bodies were broken by Simulda and reshaped again, and again. However, I never knew they were that into performance. It feels like they’d rather be a magician in life, but I think they’d do better in a slasher film than on the streets of Vegas."
    new "Simulda，融合恶魔。它们是少数接到了指示，惩罚那些过着懒惰或物欲生活的灵魂的恶魔之一。我记得它们会根据灵魂心里想的，把他们的肉体与他们作为凡人时所垂涎的物品融合在一起。他们的身体被Simulda破坏，并一次又一次地重组。不过我都不知道它们的表演欲有这么强，感觉它们更愿意当魔术师呢。虽然在我看来，比起在拉斯维加斯的街头卖艺，它们更适合去演血浆片就是了。"
