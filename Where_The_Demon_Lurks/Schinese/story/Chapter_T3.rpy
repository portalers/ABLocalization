    old "Funny, the name of the collar Morris put on Toast is the Sun Wu Kong collar. I know this from the old T.V. shows I’ve seen on Earth, there is this monkey god that had to travel with a monk, they were going to the West! Oh, that’s why it’s called Journey to the West. In the show, the monkey god had a golden headband put on him, when the monk would read out a prayer the band would tighten around the monkey god, punishing him for his misbehaviours! Apparently the show is based on a real life myth! I hope it’s just that, a myth. I don’t want to meet no monkey god, who knows what trouble that can lead to. Even if there was one, I doubt it would have survived what Paw did to their kind. Oh! Idea, ask to borrow a similar collar for my Overlord cosplay at the shop’s Halloween party!"
    new "有意思，Morris给Toast脖子上带的是孙悟空的金箍。我在人界看过那部有些年头的电视剧，讲一个神猴被迫跟一个和尚一起旅行，他们要去西方！噢，难怪它叫《西游记》来着。在电视剧里，神猴被戴上了金色的发圈，每当和尚念出一种经文，发圈就会收紧，以惩罚神猴的不端行为！我还知道，这部剧是根据现实的神话故事改编而成的！希望这只是个神话吧，我可不想遇到神猴，天知道会惹出什么样麻烦。不过嘛，即使真的有神猴，我也不认为它能在老爸对猴子干出那种事情后还能幸存下来。噢！想到个好主意，我要借一个类似的项圈，好在店里的万圣节派对上cos霸王。"

However, I never knew they were that into performance. It feels like they’d rather be a magician in life, but I think they’d do better in a slasher film than on the streets of Vegas."
