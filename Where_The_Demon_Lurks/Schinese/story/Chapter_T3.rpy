I know this from the old T.V. shows I’ve seen on Earth, there is this monkey god that had to travel with a monk, they were going to the West! Oh, that’s why it’s called Journey to the West. In the show, the monkey god had a golden headband put on him, when the monk would read out a prayer the band would tighten around the monkey god, punishing him for his misbehaviours! Apparently the show is based on a real life myth! I hope it’s just that, a myth. I don’t want to meet no monkey god, who knows what trouble that can lead to. Even if there was one, I doubt it would have survived what Paw did to their kind. Oh! Idea, ask to borrow a similar collar for my Overlord cosplay at the shop’s Halloween party!"

However, I never knew they were that into performance. It feels like they’d rather be a magician in life, but I think they’d do better in a slasher film than on the streets of Vegas."
