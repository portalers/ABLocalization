There’s a high risk of getting double crossed there. I should know, I’ve heard over the water cooler many demons boasting about how they outsmarted an exorcist. Then, the Freelancer system is us, the Underworld sending demons to Earth. That’s why there are so many rules and regulations, so that we make sure we do not affect the value of the mortal’s soul while interacting on Earth. Man, it would be a lot easier if we can just do it like how the exorcists do, but even I can tell that's not a good idea."
    new "我得把这记下来，免得和别的东西搞混。驱魔师使用召唤仪式将恶魔从冥界拉出来为他们效力，他们称之为‘魔宠’。可他们多半会被骗吧？恶魔智胜驱魔师的故事，我都在职员聊天处听过无数次了。还有，我们的自业者系统是把恶魔送到人界，所以才有那么多的条条框框，好确保我们在人界活动时不会影响人类灵魂的价值。天，如果我们也能学会驱魔师那招，事情就简单多了。但即使是我也能看出来，这不是一个好主意。"

The exorcists have their own kind of magic which we haven't been able to understand what allowed their kind to tap into this power. Maybe they have an affinity to their soul unlike usual people?  Then there's the magic of angels and demons. I can't speak for Lucian and his kind but I know the demons are granted their powers upon creation to serve the Demon Lord. When it comes to Gary and I, well... it's difficult to say. I learnt how to cast portals from Paw, but everything else he told me I would discover it on my own. Even he didn't know how he came to the powers he had. I asked Gary before but the dude never even thought about where his powers came from. Just go with the flow he says."
