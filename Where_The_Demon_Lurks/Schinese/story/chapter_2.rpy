Or so they say— most of the time, the mortal gets put in a situation where they regret taking part in the contract to begin with. Generally, low level demons aren’t allowed on Earth outside of company business.. The Demon Lord can send out demons as Freelancers, but must fill the necessary documents in triplicate. Additionally, each demon who has been approved must sit through orientation on how to be a mortal. A real snooze fest, or so I hear. There’s even an hour-long talk on the importance of blinking. Although, I wonder how many thugs Vendrake sent in order to find me."

    old "Freelancer, it’s a code word referring to demons who make contracts with mortals. Fulfilling a mortal’s wish, in exchange for possessing their bodies for a set amount of time. Or so they say— most of the time, the mortal gets put in a situation where they regret taking part in the contract to begin with. Generally, low level demons aren’t allowed on Earth outside of company business... The Demon Lord can send out demons as Freelancers, but must fill the necessary documents in triplicate. Additionally, each demon who has been approved must sit through orientation on how to be a mortal. A real snooze fest, or so I hear. There’s even an hour-long talk on the importance of blinking. Although, I wonder how many thugs Vendrake sent in order to find me."
