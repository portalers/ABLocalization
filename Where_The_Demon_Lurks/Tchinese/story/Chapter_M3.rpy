There’s a high risk of getting double crossed there. I should know, I’ve heard over the water cooler many demons boasting about how they outsmarted an exorcist. Then, the Freelancer system is us, the Underworld sending demons to Earth. That’s why there are so many rules and regulations, so that we make sure we do not affect the value of the mortal’s soul while interacting on Earth. Man, it would be a lot easier if we can just do it like how the exorcists do, but even I can tell that's not a good idea."
    new "我得把這記下來，免得和別的東西搞混。驅魔師使用召喚儀式將惡魔從冥界拉出來為他們效力，他們稱之為‘魔寵’。可他們多半會被騙吧？惡魔智勝驅魔師的故事，我都在職員聊天處聽過無數次了。還有，我們的自業者系統是把惡魔送到人界，所以才有那麼多的條條框框，好確保我們在人界活動時不會影響人類靈魂的價值。天，如果我們也能學會驅魔師那招，事情就簡單多了。但即使是我也能看出來，這不是一個好主意。"

The exorcists have their own kind of magic which we haven't been able to understand what allowed their kind to tap into this power. Maybe they have an affinity to their soul unlike usual people?  Then there's the magic of angels and demons. I can't speak for Lucian and his kind but I know the demons are granted their powers upon creation to serve the Demon Lord. When it comes to Gary and I, well... it's difficult to say. I learnt how to cast portals from Paw, but everything else he told me I would discover it on my own. Even he didn't know how he came to the powers he had. I asked Gary before but the dude never even thought about where his powers came from. Just go with the flow he says."
