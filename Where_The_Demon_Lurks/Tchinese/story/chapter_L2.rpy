    old "I usually come to the Six Fan cafe near the beginning of the month, cause that’s when I actually have enough money to spend eating out. The place used to be an empty shop front before some guy came over to rent it last year. If I recall correctly, it started out as a tour agency of some sort. The kind that takes you around the town on a supernatural trip, but it went bust after a few months. The owner of Six Fan is said to be related to the guy who ran that tour agency before. I wonder what happened to him?"

There was a city, it had this mega corporation that everyone was working for. Like the whole company had its hands in the city’s activities. The second place was nice, they all had this dragon god they all celebrated. It was a nice place, but it felt like I didn’t really belong there if I wasn’t a fan of their god. So far, minus the gang problem and the new cult in town, Kibbleton is pretty alright, but if what Lucian says is true..."
