I know this from the old T.V. shows I’ve seen on Earth, there is this monkey god that had to travel with a monk, they were going to the West! Oh, that’s why it’s called Journey to the West. In the show, the monkey god had a golden headband put on him, when the monk would read out a prayer the band would tighten around the monkey god, punishing him for his misbehaviours! Apparently the show is based on a real life myth! I hope it’s just that, a myth. I don’t want to meet no monkey god, who knows what trouble that can lead to. Even if there was one, I doubt it would have survived what Paw did to their kind. Oh! Idea, ask to borrow a similar collar for my Overlord cosplay at the shop’s Halloween party!"

Or so they say— most of the time, the mortal gets put in a situation where they regret taking part in the contract to begin with. Generally, low level demons aren’t allowed on Earth outside of company business... The Demon Lord can send out demons as Freelancers, but must fill the necessary documents in triplicate. Additionally, each demon who has been approved must sit through orientation on how to be a mortal. A real snooze fest, or so I hear. There’s even an hour-long talk on the importance of blinking. Although, I wonder how many thugs Vendrake sent in order to find me."
    new "自業者，指的是與凡人簽訂契約的惡魔。他們會滿足凡人的一個願望，以此來交換身體的主導權。聽他們說，大部分凡人都悔不當初。一般而言，除非執行公務，否則低級惡魔是不被允許出現在人界的。魔王可以以自業者的形式派遣惡魔，但必須簽署一式三份的必要文件。此外，每個被選中的惡魔都必須參加如何扮演凡人的培訓會，其中光是眨眼的重要性就要聽足足一個小時，真不愧是酣睡盛宴呢。不過，我更想知道Vendrake派了多少惡棍來人界找我。"

However, I never knew they were that into performance. It feels like they’d rather be a magician in life, but I think they’d do better in a slasher film than on the streets of Vegas."
